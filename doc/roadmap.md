# Services Roadmap
This document outlines the roadmap of features we're planning for the 2022 season.

## Milestones

The multicloud services are engineered and delivered as a set of milestones. These timelines are rough estimates, not strict rules.

## Roadmap / Timeline

Below is the schedule for when milestones will be included in release builds. The dates are rough estimates and are subject to change.


| Milestone End Date | Milestone Name | Description|Release Blog Post |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- | ---|
| 2022-04-31| v0.1 |Release of services covering GAUTH, GWS, Voice, Tenant, WWE, WebRTC, GVP, Designer||

## Issue Management

Incoming issues are triaged several times a week, labeled appropriately, and assigned to a milestone in priority order:

* P0 (serious crashes, data loss, etc.) issues are scheduled to be dealt with ASAP. These go in the current release milestone (e.g. at time of writing, these would go into 1.0).
* P1 issues/features/asks are typically assigned to the current or the following release milestone.
* P2 issues will typically go in the next quarter for the year.
* Documentation issues typically go into the current quarter.
* Issues and feature requests not related to existing features in the 22Q1/22Q2/22Q3/22Q4 quarters are assigned to the [Backlog] for subsequent triage, prioritization and scheduling.
